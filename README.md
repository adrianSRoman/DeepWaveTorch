## DeepWave: A Recurrent Neural-Network for Real-Time Acoustic Imaging (PyTorch)


This repository contains a pytorch implementation of the DeepWave model originally published at Neurips 2019

| [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/e9bf14a419d77534105016f5ec122d62-Paper.pdf) | [original code](https://github.com/imagingofthings/DeepWave) |

This is work in progress!

TODO:
* add `setup.py` to be able to `pip install -e .`
* link to colab notebook with inference examples on LOCATA, FRIDA, and DCASE 2022
* add examples that qualitatively show that this implementation is the same as the original
